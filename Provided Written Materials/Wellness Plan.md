# Wellness Plan

## Introduction

Congratulations, for taking this step towards better health - your journey begins today. Your Wellness Plan has been prepared based on your food sensitivity test results. Please note your reference number. We will need this number if you contact our office with any questions.

***Defining Food Sensitivity***

A *food sensitivity* is a delayed food reaction. Reactions can occur up to 72 hours after the food has been ingested making it difficult to pinpoint which food is causing the reaction. Symptoms can include bloating, headache, itching, gastrointestinal discomfort, and other ailments. The symptoms produced are a result of specific antibody exposure, which may include different immunoglobulins, yet most commonly by the Immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Food sensitivities may be a result of repetitive eating or lack of diversity in the diet. They are influenced by antibiotics and steroids, and possibly other medications. Cross-reactivity with environmental allergens (pollen, dust, mold, etc.) can also exacerbate food sensitivities.

If you have had an IgE blood or skin test and have had a positive reaction to a particular food, do not consume it.

Your food sensitivity test showed a positive reaction to 13 foods. We recommend that you read your Wellness Plan completely before starting your elimination diet. It is divided into sections:

- Foods to Exclude - this section details the foods that you tested positive to, which should be removed from your diet, as well as hidden sources of those foods.
- Special Consideration Pages - these provide more detailed information about certain foods.
- Shopping List - use this list to help with grocery shopping
- 4-Day Rotation Diet - this is a guide to help you organize your own 4-day rotation mal plan.
- Sample Food Diary - a suggested food log for the re-introduction of foods.
- Resources.

### Understanding Your Wellness Plan

The Wellness Plan is an eating program based on the elimination of your reactive foods. Any food on your test result that scored Class 1\*, 2\**, or 3\*** for IgG (sensitivity) has been eliminated from your Wellness Plan. Its main purpose is to give your immune system time to rest and prevent the development of new food sensitivities.

We recommend that you avoid these reactive foods for at least 8-12 weeks and follow the rotation part of your Wellness Plan. You may not feel relief from your symptoms initially. In fact, you may crave some of the foods you have removed from your diet.

The purpose of the elimination and rotation plan is to eliminate foods that you have become sensitive to and rotate other nutritious foods into your diet. The plan provides food suggestions for each day in a four-day cycle. We recommend that you spend the first week on the plan focusing on the foods you need to eliminate. You may move any food on days 1-4 to another day to suit your meal planning. The main principle of the Wellness Plan is not to consume the same foods on consecutive days.

**Your practitioner may have different guidelines which should be followd.**

### Reintroducting Foods

- After 8-12 weeks of eliminating foods you reacted to, you are ready to start re-introducing foods. Begin with Class 1 foods to start re-introduction phase.
- Try one culprit food every four days to see if you can tolerate it.
- On the first day of reintroducing food, consume 2-3 servings of that food in its purest form.
- Please keep a food diary and make notes of any symptoms, which may take up to 72 hours to develop.
- If there is a reaction, or if any symptoms that have resolved during the elimination phase re-occur, remove the food from your diet again, as this may indicate that you are still not tolerating it.
- Foods you are able to tolerate may be added back into your diet on a rotation basis.
- Once all Class 1 sensitive foods are re-introduced move on to re-introducing Class 2 foods and finally Class 3 foods.

## Foods to Exclude

**The table below lists all foods you reacted to under "Positive Foods". Additional foods to exclude and hidden sources of those foods are listed in the next two columns. It is important to always read food labels. Definitions can be found at the bottom of the table.**

## Special Considerations

### Yeast

Your test results showed a positive score for both baker's yeast and brewer's yeast. Foods that are high in sugar and simple carbohydrates should be avoided, see *foods to avoid*.

You may find that you feel worse before you feel better on a yeast elimination diet. It is not uncommon to crave sweets and "comfort" foods. Drink plenty of water and eat whole and minimally processed foods.

> *Tip:* Use a lettuce leaf or blanched large green leaf to make wraps to replace sandwiches.

***Foods to avoid:***

- Sugar in all forms: table sugar, organic brown sugar, raw sugar, honey, sucrose, fructose, molasses, agave nectar, maple syrup, artificial sweeteners.
- Fruit juice, dried fruit, fruits high in sugar (bananas, dates, grapes, watermelon)
- Aged cheeses
- Mushrooms, fungi, truffles
- Sweetened beverages, soda, sports drinks
- Refined grains, white rice, pasta, potatoes
- Yeast breads
- Vinegar, commercial salad dressing, pickles, mustard
- Processes meats, deli meats, smoked meats
- Chocolate, candy
- Alcohol

### Egg

Egg sensitivity may occur as a result of over consumption of eggs or cross reactivity with environmental allergens.

If you have tested positive to egg white or egg yolk we suggest that you remove chicken eggs from your diet during the elimination phase of your Wellness Plan.

> *Tip:* Egg substitute suggestions are: duck or ostrich eggs, ground flax seed and apple juice, commercial egg replacer, baking powder with vinegar and water.

***Foods to avoid:***

- Egg in all forms - boiled, poached, fried, coddled
- Egg white, egg yolk, dried egg, egg beaters
- Ice cream, custards, puddings
- Quiche
- Meringues, macaroons, eclairs, cakes, cookies, waffles, pancakes
- Egg noodles, pasta
- Clear soups, Hollandaise sauce, other egg based sauce, mayonnaise

## Frequently Asked Questions

What defines a day within the 4-day rotation?

> A day is defined as a 24-hour period. Many people consider waking and sleeping as a day; however, this would vary greatly depending on how many hours one sleeps or stays awake. By using the 24-hour rule you may find it easier for meal planning. For example, dinner left-overs could be consumed the next "day" for breakfast or lunch.

Can I move foods around to suit my eating habits?

> Yes, you may move foods from one day to another. However, once you have moved a food or food group, you should leave it on the day you have moved it to.

What about foods that are not listed in my 4-day rotation?

> If you would liek to include food that you have not been tested for, and have no had no adverse reaction to that food in the past, you may incorporate it into your 4-day rotation plan.

Can I use salt?

> Yes, you may use salt. We do not recommend an excessive amount of salt in the diet. (See USDA Nutrition Guidelines for daily recommended intake of salt).

I tested positive to a food that I never consume - why?

> Food sensitivities can be influenced by cross reactions with other foods and/or environmental allergies/sensitivities. For example, if you have an allergy to dust mites you may test positive for shellfish, or if you have an allergy to latex you may test positive to avocados or poppy seed.

What if I accidentally consume an item that I tested positive to?

> This does not mean that you have to start over - just carry on with your elimination and rotation plan.

There is nothing to drink!

> We recommend drinking plenty of water and herbal teas. If you are eliminating cow's mil from your diet, try one of the milk substitutes such as hemp milk, coconut milk, almond milk. If you are eliminating coffee or tea, try green tea.

Do you use organic foods for your testing?

> The food extracts used for our testing are sourced from FDA approved suppliers. Whether the food extracts are from organic sources or conventionally produced sources, does not affect the test result.

Can I use nut and seed oils if I am sensitive to the nut or seed?

> Although the oils may have been removed from your Wellness Plan, in most cases they can be safely consumed if highly refined. Oils that do not meet this criteria such as cold-pressed or gourmet oils may not be sage to consume as they may contain traces of the problem protein. Please discuss with your practitioner.

What type of bran is tested?

> We test wheat bran. You may use rice bran or oat bran so long as you are not sensitive to rice or oats.

I tested positive to eggs, why are duck eggs on my shopping list?

> You were tested for chicken egg sensitivity. You may safely consume duck eggs or ostrich eggs as they are from different food families.

## Food Log

Some clients find it helpful to keep a food re-introduction log to monitor symptoms as foods are brought back into the plan. Below is a sample food re-introduction log. If you experience any symptoms within three days of re-introducing a food, we recommend that you remove the food form your plans and try it again in a few weeks.

Date | Time | Food Re-Introduced | Amount Eaten | Symptoms | Date & Time Symptoms Occurred
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
 | | | | | 
 | | | | | 
 | | | | | 
 | | | | | 
 | | | | | 

For example, let's say you have avoided carrots for the last 12 weeks and now you want to re-introduce them into your diet:

Date | Time | Food Re-Introduced | Amount Eaten | Symptoms | Date & Time Symptoms Occurred
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2/21 | Lunch | Carrots, roasted | 1 cup | bloating | 2/23 bloating, pm

You might associate bloating with carrots introduced two days prior, in which case, we suggest that you remove carrots from the plan and try them in a few weeks.

## Reading Labels and Healthy Eating

**Reading Labels**

The 2006 Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Act (FALCPA) has helped to take some of the stress out of label reading.

Before purchasing any processed foods you should carefully read the food labels and the ingredient lists to ensure these products do not contain any offending foods. Supplements should also be carefully checked. If you are unsure of any ingredient, contact the manufacturer of the product for clarification, and check with your practitioner.

The most common "allergenic" foods include eggs, milk, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, shellfish, fish and wheat. All FDA regulated manufactured food products that contain any of these, as an ingredient, are required by U.S. law to list them on the product label.

**Tips to Healthy Eating**

A healthy, balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups: vegetables, fruits, grains, protein sources and healthy fats and oil.
- Plan ahead and use the shopping list provided to help create a healthy eating plan.
- Your shopping list is a guide and not limited to only the foods listed.
- Consume adequate calories and nutrients for overall health.
- For adequate fluid intake, drink 6-8 glasses of water per day.
- Avoid alcoholic beverages. Alcohol interferes with the healing process.
- Avoid empty calories from foods high in sugar such as juices, soda, candy and sweets.
- Choose nutrient dense and fresh foods over processed foods.
- Frozen meat, fish, and produce are acceptable alternatives when fresh is not available.
- When dining away from home ask questions regarding food preparation.
- Have fun trying new foods and recipes.
