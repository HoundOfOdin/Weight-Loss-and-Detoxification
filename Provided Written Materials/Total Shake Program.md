# Total Shake Program

For Support of Weight Loss and Detoxification

## Phase 1 - Detoxification

### What the Total Shake Program Accomplishes

Proper metabolism is necessary for burning calories. This program has been made available to support metabolic cleansing in your body. Metabolic cleansing is designed to reduce your body's load of toxic substances, which may be present from either external substances (drugs, chemicals, alcohol, diet) or your own physiological activities (bacterial toxins, intestinal toxins, metabolic by-products). My patients that followed this program, achieved weight loss, better sleep, more energy, and most importantly, they reduced or eliminated the symptom that was bothering them the most.

***WARNING:*** Total Shake is to be used under the direct supervision of a physician or other licensed health care practitioner. Do not engage in any diet supplying less than 800 calories per day without medical supervision. If you are diabetic do not engage in any diet supplying less than 800 calories per day. ***(see modified program)***

This is a 21-day detoxification program (additional weeks can be added for severely toxic people). This booklet will guide you through each phaser of the program. People who followed these guidelines got the best results. Individual results may vary.

### Days 1-3 (Initial Cleansing Phase)

**Drink**
> 5-8 Total Shakes per day (2 scoops mixed with 8 oz. of water, not juice).
> Also, drink 8 *additional* glasses of water throughout the day.

**When to Drink the Shakes**
> Drink the Total Shakes every 3 hours. (Example: at 7 a.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 7 p.m.). ***It is very important not to go more than 3 hours without a shake. Also, do NOT skip a shake.*** If you skip one, your blood sugar can drop. If this occurs, it is hard to recover your energy for the rest of the day, and this can be harmful to your health. Additionally, decreased blood suger can increase your cravings tremendously. If still hungry...have another shake.

**Can I Eat Anything Else in the First 3 Days?**
> No. Other foods, including gum and mints, are to be eliminated, unless otherwise advised by your doctor.

### Days 4-21

**Drink**
> 3-5 Total Shakes per day (2 scoops mixed with 8 oz. of water, not juice). Also, drink 8 *additional* glasses of water throughout the day.

**Eat**
> 1 meal. The meal should consist of fish, or chicken and white rice or brown rice. (No shrimp, lobster, instant rice, etc.)

**How to Prepare**
> Bake, broil, or grill the fish or chicken (no breading or frying). You may use olive oil on the meat and *only* these spices: basil, thyme, oregano, parsley, dill, fresh lemon, fresh lime, or fresh ginger. Use minimal salt and pepper.

**When to Eat the Meal**
> You may eat your meal anytime during the day. I recommend lunchtime because, along with your shakes, it gives you the highest likelihood to have normal blood sugar throughout the afternoon hours.

**How Much Can I Eat at Each Meal While I Am on the Total Shake Program?**
> You are not limited in how much protein (chicken or fish) you eat. You should keep your serving of rice to no more than one cup of cooked rice.

**Is It Okay for Me to Have Additional Shakes If I Get Hungry?**
> Yes, you can have up to 8 shakes a day. All that happens is that you have more vitamin and mineral replenishment.

### What to Expect

**Will I Feel Sick or Miserable During the Detox?**
> Most people feel much better almost immediately upon starting Total Shake because it supplies many of the nutrients their body needs for normal function. However, there are people who experience undesirable symptoms, such as: fatigue, nausea, headaches, weakness, lethargy, and sometimes diarrhea. If that happens to you it is important for you to know why, because the general rule is - the worse you feel, the more you need to do it. Remember, if you have not felt well for a long time, or you are overweight, or have some chronic illness, your body is probably not functioning very well. Your body may be addicted to sugar, caffeine, large meals, foods, and more. When you start any detox program you are eliminating daily habits that your body has gotten used to over the years. It can be similar to someone who stops drinking alcohol after 20 years of normal use. They will feel horrible for quite some time before they feel the benefit from quitting. What would happen to them if they quit the detox? They would be right back where they started or worse. So, stick with it. You may need to extend your detox for another 21 days if necessary. Just make sure to keep your doctor informed of any difficulty you are having and follow their advice.

**Will I Be Hungry?**
> Not usually. You might miss chewing food, but people find that the Total Shake is quite filling. If you are hungry, then you may drink up to 8 shakes the first 3 days but, please do not add additional food.

**Will I Ever Get Used to the Chalky and Bland Taste of Total Shakes?**
> Usually the transition onto the Total Shake program is smooth and most people like the taste. However, there is a small percentage of people who find the texture and the taste not to their liking at first. These people have a habit of eating foods with a high sugar, salt, and fat content regularly, and they are usually not as healthy as they would like to be. Because of this they are used to food tasting a certain way and are looking for instant gratification and pleasure from all their meals. If this happens to you, just make sure to remind yourself of the purpose for doing the program. You have made the decision to take the steps to improve your health. Stick to your guns - you have made the right decision. The key is to follow the program exactly regardless of the taste your body will adjust to its improved health and you will start to enjoy the taste of the shake. If may be hard to believe but you will most likely look forward to having your daily shakes not only for the health content but also for the flavor, so stick with it.

**What About Bowel Movements? Will I Feel "Constipated" While on the Total Shake?**
> It is important to have at least one bowel movement daily while on the Total Shake since this is a major way toxins are eliminated from your body. However, people have been mislead to believe that they should have several ***large*** bowel movements every day. A bowel movement is simply the body eliminating waste. Because people eat so poorly, they don't absorb their food. They end up with a toxic, putrefying intestine filled with unabsorbed food, which leads to excessively large bowel movements to get rid of all the waste. Total Shake is designed to give your body the nutrients it needs for normal metabolism and energy production. It is close to being a perfect food and your body should absorb almost all of it. ***Therefore, very little waste is produced and you may find that your bowel movements are smaller and less frequent. In most cases this is not constipation but is a normal intestinal response to low amounts of waste.*** Let's face it. If there is a small amount of waste then your bowel movements will be small. They will mostly contain the toxins and putrefied foods that are being eliminated because of the cleanse. If you have any difficulty, you can add ***Cal Mac Tea*** to your daily routine and that may help. If the problem consists for more than 1 day, consult your physician.

**IF I Have Trouble Sleeping During the Detox, What Should I Do?**
> The stress of any detox program can cause your body to be on the edge. This can lead to muscle tension, irritability and sleep disturbance. The best solution for this is to supplement the body with ***Cal Mac Tea***. This is a soothing relaxing mineral blend that is designed for easy absorption even in a distressed intestine. You can order ***Cal Mac Tea*** from the office.

**Should I Exercise During the Total Shake Program?**
> It is a good idea to exercise while on the program. Take it very easy throughout the time you are detoxifying, because it is likely you may have reduced energy and stamina. Also, this is not the time to become Superman. You are undergoing a detox program, and the body needs its strength. A good rule is to involve yourself in 20 minutes of light aerobic activity.

### Total Shake can be used for an extended period of time after the initial cleansing program.

1. You can continue to do the original Total Shake program with 1 to 2 meals per day.
2. Use it as a meal replacement or a snack.
3. Do a 3-7 day detox if you've made mistakes.

If you are still noticing positive changes as you are finishing your 21 days, don't change anything. You are probably still detoxifying and need the nutrition that Total Shake is supplying to your body. You've seen how much better you feel from the Total Shake so don't fall back into old habits or go through the ups and downs of diets and detox programs. You now have the knowledge to handle your health long-term and once and for all. *Keep it up!*

## Total Shake as a Meal Replacement

**Total Shake can be used as a meal replacement and not just for detoxification.**

If you really don't want to change your diet, but still want to improve your health, lose weight, increase your energy, and get the pain out of your body, Total Shakes can be used as a meal replacement and meal supplement.

## How to Use

**Total Shake is the ideal meal for everyone!**

Simply eat like you normally do, only now add 1 or more Total Shakes per day as a meal replacement or in between meals. It can also be used as a snack or pick-me-up any time you like.

Total Shake makes a quick and satisfying meal when you are too busy to stop and prepare a meal.

When energy slides in the afternoon a "second lunch", between lunch and dinner, of Total Shake does the trick.

Total Shake is what you need. It cleanses your liver, increases your metabolism and booms your energy. The more shakes you add in per day, the more youthful you will feel, and the more benefits you will notice.

## The Nobody's Perfect Clause:

**Troubleshooting Section for Those of Us who are not Perfect.**

In no way am I condoning going off the program. The way to make it to your goals is to stay on the program all the way through. However, certain situations in life occur that make it sometimes near impossible to follow the program such as weddings, super bowl, vacations, etc. In these times it is important that you don't just quit your program only because you have indulged, binged, gone off the deep end or just blown it completely. This means you have eaten things you know you shouldn't like pizza, coke, coffee, ice cream, alcohol, fast food, French fries, chocolate, and other similar foods. The section below is designed to help you transition back onto the program without losing the gains that you have worked so hard to attain.

1. If you cheat for one meal, take 5 Total Shakes the next day with one approved meal selection. Then go right back onto your program.
2. If you cheat more than one meal but not more than 1 day, then do 2 days with 5 Total Shakes each day along with one meal selection per day.
3. If you cheat 2-3 days, then do 3 days with 5 Total Shakes each day, along with one meal selection per day.
4. If you cheat 4-7 days, then do 4 days with 5 Total Shakes each day, along with one meal selection per day.
5. If you cheat more than a week, restart your program and do Phase I.

**Instant Repair Phase:**

> If at any time you get off your program, cheat on the bad foods, have difficulty in making decisions about what to eat, or just plain do bette when you are on the shake, immediately start again with a 3-Day Detox and then carry on with at least 3 shakes per day. This can be done as often as you like.
